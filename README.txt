=====================================
Final Project for Java 2:
Basic Check Register

Collaborators:
    Kelly Kurkowski
    Wendy Yang

THE IDEA
- We wanted to digitize the simple
  paper check register to track our
  spending
- The idea was to be able to add
  expenditures and income to an
  ArrayList so that the user can:
  - Get the current available balance
  - See how much has been spent on
    certain categories (i.e.; how
    much was spent on food, gas, etc.)
  - Sort the list of transactions
  - Search the list for a certain
    keyword
